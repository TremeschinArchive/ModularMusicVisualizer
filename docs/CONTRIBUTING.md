# Contributing

So you decided to contribute to the project, there are a lot of ways you can help this project grow!!

First and foremost, this is a hobby project and I don't want any war happening around here, everything here (until the time I'm writing this) was made all by myself and with voluntary work of helping the music production (specifically the bedroom producer) community.

The project is free to use and free (as in freedom) to modify and utilize the way you want.

If you're a developer and thinking on forking the project and making your own version, I gently ask you to think if that's really the best thing to do as some projects may lose its focus when too much fragmentation happens, think if combining efforts would be worse or better than driving your own fork.

## Spreading

I won't force you to credit MMV when using this project to release your tracks. However, as a way to thank me and other contributors, we would appreciate mentioning and/or linking to this project.

If you don't link this project in the main description and if people ask how you made the visuals for the video, please answer that person as there's interest on the project

## Finding / reporting issues

You can help the project grow by finding issues that my test environment can't detect and / or finding fixes for those, but that requires coding so stick on reporting issues if you don't want to dive deep into the project.

As a general rule of thumb, things will go easier if you follow a guideline when writing issues, but it's not something absolute so instead I'll give you a list of general recomendations.

- What operating system you are on?

- Describe the issue

- Steps to reproduce (if any)

- Additional information (if any)

- What have you tried?

I don't want to sound rude but low effort issues might be annoying to understand or find a fix, so please do some research and find the specifics scenarios the issue happens.

You can also DM me and ask if a proper issue ticket should be created or not. I personally don't mind, feel free for anything around here.

## Coding

I mostly follow Python's [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) _Style Guide for Python Code_ on formatting Python code tho that's not absolutely true.

The best way is to just read the source code, its styling is about 80% consistent through all the code base.

I prefer code readability and modularity rather than hardcoded methods as you can see in some more global wrapper classes. Don't hesitate on refactoring some class to a new file.

Also please don't be lazy on not commenting the code on what it's doing, only when I'm rushing some R&D I don't comment stuff but layer on at some point if it works I'll be commenting the code.

I don't expect many people to be contributing with code at least until the project is somewhat production-ready, just writing this just in case someone happens to be interested.

Also see the [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) for a short guide on MMV's code structure.
